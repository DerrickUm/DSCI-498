# DSCI-498
Git repo for DSCI-498 project incorporating EY's Open Data Science Challenge

The usage of generative models in solving critical issues of climate and sustainability is in its infancy stages. This project seeks to apply contemporary advancements in machine learning and generative artificial intelligence with the goal of discerning key factors that contribute to the development of heat island hotspots, and foster further awareness of the applications of machine learning and generative modeling in critical societal issues. For context, the urban heat island effect is a phenomenon that occurs when there are drastic temperature variations between rural and urban areas, which can exceed 10-degrees Celsius, and have severe effects on vulnerable communities, especially young children, older adults, laborers, and other communities. Using near-surface air temperature data from July 24th, 2021, a machine learning model will be developed to predict heat island hotspots in urban locations, and discern the root causes.
